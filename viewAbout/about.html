    <h1>Me?</h1>

    <p>Oh me... you wanted to know about me!</p>
    <p>
        I'm a software developer currently based in Toronto, but you're more likely to find me online.<br>
        I spend my time writing random tools and apps, smashing out hours on video games, pouring countless hours theorycrafting.<br>
        What else?  I get excited over code, computers, and cracking open my gadgets, though sometimes they don't come back in one piece.<br>
        I doodle and spill ideas out onto paper, but more often a PSD file.<br>
    </p>
    What will we see today?
